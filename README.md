## Features

### Basic components

**The observer** has vision and can move and turn.

**The map** consists of edges and can be imported through Tikz.

### Ray-tracing

**Intersection detection and distance calculation** between rays (from the observer) and edges (from the map) are done through vector geometry.

**Distance-to-height transformation** is done through a semi-inverse function based on convex lens optics.

### Map display

**Fixed-camera mode** and **fixed-map mode** can be toggled.
