# Ray-tracing
A Senior Year Computer Science I.S. Project.

## Intersection detection and distance calculation

As for now, intersections would mostly be between rays (with position and direction) and edges (with two endpoints). This allows us to achieve fast intersection detection and distance calculation with vector geometry.

## Map, observer control and visual feedback
