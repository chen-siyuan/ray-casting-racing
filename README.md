# Ray-tracing

A Senior Year Computer Science I.S. Project.

## Intersection detection and distance calculation

As for now, intersections would mostly be between rays (with position and direction) and edges (with two endpoints). This allows us to achieve fast intersection detection and distance calculation with vector geometry.

## Observer control and map control

### Observer control

The user would be able to control the movements (forward/backward + turning) of the observer. The user would not be able to change the number of rays nor the span of vision of the observer.

### Map control

The user would be able to add/remove (straight) edges in the map.

## Map display and vision display

### Map display

The map (edges) and the range of vision (central ray + edge rays) of the observer would be displayed.

### Vision display

The vision perceived by the observer would be displayed in form of a bar graph.
